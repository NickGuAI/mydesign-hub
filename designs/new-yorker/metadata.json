  "description": "A UI design system inspired by Manhattan's Upper West Side brownstones, off-Broadway theater culture, and the quiet confidence of old New York money. Warm linen backgrounds, tarnished brass accents, oxblood leather tones, and mahogany dark modes create interfaces that feel inherited rather than designed. Components reference wainscoting, herringbone parquet, playbills, and engraved nameplates — everything whispers refinement without ever raising its voice.",
